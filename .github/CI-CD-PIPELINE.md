### Understanding the Unit Test Workflow

This document explains the workflow for running unit tests and checking code coverage using GitHub Actions. It is based on the ci.yml file you have. This workflow automates the process of testing your code every time a change is pushed or a pull request is made, helping to ensure the stability and quality of your application.

### Workflow Components

The workflow is broken down into several key steps:

#### 1\. Triggers

The on section defines when the workflow should run. In this case, it's triggered by two events:

- A push to the main branch.
- A pull_request targeting the main branch.

This ensures that all new code is automatically tested before it can be merged into the main codebase.

#### 2\. Jobs

The jobs section contains one job named test-and-coverage. A job is a set of steps that are executed on a single virtual machine.

- runs-on: ubuntu-latest: This specifies that the job will run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine provided by GitHub.

#### 3\. Steps

The steps are the individual tasks that the job performs in sequence:

1.  **Checkout repository**: The actions/checkout@v4 action downloads your repository's code into the virtual machine, so the workflow can access your project files.
2.  **Setup Node.js**: This step uses the actions/setup-node@v4 action to install a specific version of Node.js (20 in this case), which is required to run your npm scripts.
3.  **Install dependencies**: The npm ci command installs your project's dependencies. It's similar to npm install but is optimized for clean, automated environments like a CI server.
4.  **Run unit tests with coverage**: The npm run test:cov command executes the test:cov script defined in your package.json. This script, in turn, runs Jest with the --coverage flag, generating a code coverage report.
5.  **Check code coverage**: This crucial step uses a third-party action, artiomtr/jest-coverage-report-action@v2. It reads the coverage report generated in the previous step and compares the total coverage percentage against the specified threshold (in this case, 5). If the coverage falls below this threshold, the workflow will fail, providing a clear signal that the code quality has dropped.

### Benefits of this Workflow

- **Automation**: It eliminates the need for manual testing and reporting.
- **Quality Gates**: By enforcing a minimum coverage threshold, it acts as a quality gate, preventing code that is not adequately tested from being merged.
- **Rapid Feedback**: Developers receive immediate feedback on their code, allowing them to catch bugs and issues early in the development cycle.
- **Consistency**: The same testing process is applied to all code, ensuring a consistent level of quality across the entire codebase.
